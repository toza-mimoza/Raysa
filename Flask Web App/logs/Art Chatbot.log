Occasionally, this can be a useful and clear way to notate something which would otherwise look messy. I don't think it's a particularly 'old' way.

Any notation program that supports clef symbols as simple, non-functioning graphic objects could notate this. Playback would be another matter! (Though easily enough achieved by muting the displayed notes and adding them in an additional, hidden voice).

Here's a practical alternative. I suspect I prefer it as notation. But it's not fun getting the ties to go where you want them. in Sibelius at any rate! (You'll note that I copped out of the challenge. Give it a try in YOUR notation program.)

Picea is the modern scientific name for the spruce genus, but its application to just spruces, like the application of Pinus to just pines and Abies to just firs (and indeed the narrowing of those categories in English), is a modern convention that basically became a thing faute de mieux.

The Latin word picea is derived from pix 'pitch', and in principle could be applied to any tree whose primary use to humans was to produce resin, which is why L&S have it as 'pitch-pine' (they also somewhat untenably specify that it's Pinus silvestris, the Scots pine, which you'll note is not actually the tree conventionally called the pitch pine today, Pinus rigida—a New World tree the Romans didn't know about).
Classifying trees by use is historically obviously more common than classifying them by genetic affinity, which meant names could apply to multiple species of trees at the same time or change over time. Compare e.g. Latin fagus 'beech', mainly used for its beech nuts as animal feed, to the Greek cognate φηγός 'oak', mainly used for its acorns as animal feed; this is a clear example of a phenomenon that happens in every language, and its often impossible to determine which specific species of tree any given instance of a tree name refers to in a text. When a pre-Linnaean Latin author uses picea, just assume they mean a resin-producing conifer or a tree that looks like one, and translate it accordingly.

(Compare also the modern Christmas tree, which, depending on the region, can refer specifically to the Norway spruce; specifically to the Scots pine; to almost any coniferous evergreen; or even to any tree that will hold Christmas lights.)
