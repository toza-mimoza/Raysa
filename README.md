# Raysa
Ray-based Distributed Multi-Node Cluster of Rasa Open Source Intelligent Assistants

This is the repository for the front end component of the Raysa system of distributed Rasa assistants using Ray distributed framework. It is written using the Flask web microframework and acts as an interface between a user of the platform and (multiple) chatbots with whom the user may talk to, but not knowing it from which chatbot the response is coming from specifically. Raysa front end platform allows for the modularity of chatbot knowledge and consequently allowing the teams, that usually work on completely isolated chatbots in the company, to present their results together in a modular way.
